# This playbook is to install graphite and grafana with its dependencies.

Introduction: 

There is graPHite (ph) and then there is graFana (f). Graphite is the main tool that collects the data for graphing. It also has a simple graphing tool.
Grafana sits on top of graphite. It is a much prettier and versatile graphing tool. It uses the data in graphite.

# Building a graphite host on OpenStack 

Building OpenStack Console: 
Choose Managing region from the dropdown. Click on "Instances"
Upper right - click on the box "+ Launch Instance"
On the pop-up window

'Details' tab:
Availability Zone - Nova
Instance name - this can be your choice... see the table above for existing names.
Flavor - needs to be "m1.xlarge | 16GB RAM | 8 VCPU | 20.0GB Disk"
Instance Boot Source - "Cloud CentOS 6.6 x86_64 v1.2" .
Security Tab
Keypair - will be yours
Click the '+' to upload your ssh key if you haven't before.
this is critical or no one will have access to the box.
Admin Pass - you can leave this blank
Security Groups - select the "default" and "graphite" Security Groups.
Networking Tab
Add the PublicBlue network by clicking the '+' in the Available Networks box. It will move from the Available Networks area to the Selected Networks area.
Click "launch" to build the host.
Look for your new instance in the list... find your new ip address.
You should be able to access the host over ssh with your user account. 
Verify you can access with ssh username <ip_address>


Install Grafana & dependencies:

Once the host is built and you are able to access over ssh, you can run the graphite-install.yml playbook to install all graphite and grafana with all the needed dependencies.

Run the playbook against the host you want to build:

# ansible-playbook graphite-install.yml 

Verify Installation  --  http://<ip_address_of_server>

Need to add one A record for graphite and one CNAME record for grafana and both will point to the fqdn of the graphite host

Apache Configuration: 

The apache configuration, a virtual server will be configured so that two webpages resolve the graphite page & the grafana page.
Three files need to be modifed

/etc/httpd/conf.d/01_graphite.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.d/02_grafana.conf
/usr/share/grafana/config.js
/etc/httpd/conf.d/01_graphite.conf
Set ServerName parameter to the fqnd of graphite 
Set Access-Control-Origin to the fqnd of grafana

example /etc/httpd/conf.d/01_graphite.conf file
# Graphite Web Basic mod_wsgi vhost

<VirtualHost *:80>

    <Location "/media/">

</VirtualHost>


Set ServerName to the grafana fqdn
example /etc/httpd/conf.d/02_grafana.conf file


<VirtualHost *:80>

    # change this ServerName to the fqdn of the GRAFANA server's cname/alias being used
    ServerName grafana.com                                             # <------------------ fqdn of grafana

    ProxyPass /elasticsearch http://localhost:9200
    ProxyPassReverse /elasticsearch http://localhost:9200

</VirtualHost>
/usr/share/grafana/config.js
set graphite url & grafana elasticsearch url parameters
set data sources with graphite & grafana URL's
      datasources: {
        graphite: {
          type: 'graphite',
          url: 'http://graphite.com',                     # <------------------- graphite url
        },
        elasticsearch: {
          type: 'elasticsearch',
          url: 'http://grafana.com/elasticsearch',        # <------------------- grafana url + /elasticsearch
          index: 'grafana-dash',
          grafanaDB: true,
        }
      },
	  
Configure Retention: 

By default, only two days of data is kept, modify with the following steps:

Edit /etc/carbon/storage-schemas.conf to add the following:
[3min_1month]
pattern = ^.*\.3min\..*
retentions = 3m:30d

If Statistics have already been collected with the defualt Retention configuration, .wsp files will have to be resized:
find & resize the .wsp files
find /var/lib/carbon/whisper/converge/3min/ -name '*.wsp' -exec /usr/bin/whisper-resize --nobackup {} 3m:30d \;

Be sure permissions are still carbon:carbon 
chown -R carbon:carbon /var/lib/carbon/whisper/converge/3min/
restart the carbon-cache daemon
/etc/init.d/carbon-cache restart.
